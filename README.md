Twimba is a simple clone of the Twitter interface, containing a number of tweets and working functionalities such as like, retweet, and comment.

This project was completed during the Essential JavaScript Concepts course.

- Even though I solved the challenges of this project by myself before seeing the instructor's solution, this project cannot count as a solo project for me.
- However, I have created this repo so I can add on top of it and implement more features that I have in mind.
